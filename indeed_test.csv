Summary
Build the next generation of tools for the country’s top law firms and trial litigators.
MFB Technologies is a LegalTech startup hiring skilled web and mobile front-end developers looking to work in a collaborative and flexible startup environment with enormous growth potential. This market is exploding; last year alone LegalTech companies received over a billion dollars in funding. If you are interested in putting your development skills to work in this area, keep reading.
Our Company
Founded by a partner at one of the nation’s most elite law firms, MFB Technologies is building modern applications for today’s top lawyers. Our products were conceived and designed with the insight gained from our founder’s 15+ years as a trial lawyer. Those products are now being developed using modern development tools, frameworks, and languages, including Javascript/Typescrupt, React, ASP.Net Core, C#, and Swift.
We are a startup through and through. We pride ourselves on teamwork, collaboration, flexibility, and open-mindedness. We want our employees to believe in our mission, grow with our company, invest in our future, and reap the rewards of our success.
The Position
We are hiring front-end developers for our web applications. Qualified candidates will have strong skills in JavaScript/TypeScript and React, the ability to write rigorous unit and integration tests, and a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. Candidates should also be comfortable working in an Agile development environment using Jira, git and similar tools.
We are a growth mindset company, and we are not dogmatic about our tech. Accordingly, in addition to having the skills identified above, the best-suited candidates for this position will have solid problem-solving abilities and a strong desire to learn new technologies and expand their skills. We believe all developers benefit from a broad understanding of the full tech stack. As a result, we encourage our front-end developers to “move up the stack,” learning and gaining experience in new and unfamiliar technologies.
Candidates will work remotely, but in a highly interactive environment using chat and video conferencing.
What We Offer
MFB Technologies offers a collaborative, informal environment with enormous opportunities for continuous learning and growth. We pay competitive salaries commensurate with education and experience. We provide health insurance and sick leave. Because we believe strongly that our employees should have a chance to participate in our success, all employees can participate in our stock options plan.

"Software Engineer, Full Stack","San Francisco, CA 94110 (Mission area)",Notion,None,"About Us:
We make software that anyone can mold and shape to take on every challenge — from taking personal notes to running large companies. Usually based in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco, we've been building together since 2016, are backed by Index Ventures, First Round Capital, and trusted by customers including Nike, New Relic, Verizon, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.
About The Role:
Remember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.
What You'll Do:
You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.
You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.
You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.
What We're Looking For:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
Bonus Points:
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.",http://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=8b42bfc2d289e353&fccid=b6a22a06e345134a&vjs=3
